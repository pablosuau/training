    "**2E4** The Bayesian statistician Bruno de Finetti (1906–1985) began his book on probability theory with the declaration: “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST.”  The capitals appeared in the original, so I imagine de Finetti wanted us to shout this statement. What he meant is that probability is a device for describing uncertainty from the perspective of an observer with limited knowledge; it has no objective reality. Discuss the globe tossing example from the chapter, in light of this statement. What does it mean to say “the probability of water is 0.7”?\n",
