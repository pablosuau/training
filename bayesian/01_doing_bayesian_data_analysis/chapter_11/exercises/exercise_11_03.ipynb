    "**Exercise 11.3. [Purpose: To determine the $p$ value when data collection stops at a fixed duration.]** (For another example of NHST for fixed-duration samples, see Kruschke, 2010.) We continue with the scneario of the previous exercises: a dichotomous outcome, with $N=45$ and $z=3$. Suppose that the die-roller of the previous exercises stopped rolling because time expired at 6 min. For simplicity, suppose $N=42$, through $N=50$, with equal probability. What is the $p$ value of the observed outcome? Is it the same $p$ value as when assuming fixed $N$ or fixed $z$?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hints*: We need to compute the $p$ value for each possible $N$, and then average them according to the probability they would happen. For each $N$, the low tail consists of outcomes that are a proportion less than or equal to the observed $z/N=3/45$. Examine the following R script. Explain exactly what it does and interpret its output."
