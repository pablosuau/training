    "In this notebook, I will summarise the process required to perform an Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA test), including the steps required to make sure that the data fits the requirements for an ANOVA test. The aim of ANOVA is to test whether the mean of a set of populations is similar. In order to do that, a sample is extracted from each population, an we perform a test with the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis: the mean of all the populations is the same\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis: at least one of the populations has a different mean\n",

    "The reason why we perform ANOVA instead of multiple two-sample t-tests is because such a process would be prone to induce Type I errors: due to the randomness of the data it is likely of find a difference between two populations even if such difference does not exist. "
