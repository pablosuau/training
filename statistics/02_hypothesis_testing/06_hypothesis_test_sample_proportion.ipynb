If the conditions to ensure that the sampling distribution of the proportion is almost normal hold we can apply the same techniques we already applied in [this notebook](./02_Hypothesis_testing_based_on_the_normal_model.ipynb) for the population mean. There are, however, some changes in the way the standard error is calculated. \n",
