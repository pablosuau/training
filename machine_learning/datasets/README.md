# Machine learning datasets

This directory contains the datasets used in the `machine_learning` folder in my training repository:

* `logistic_regression_1d.csv`: a simple manually produced 1D dataset specially designed for Logistic Regression.
* `logistic_regression_2d.csv`: a simple classification example dataset downloaded from [https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning). Only the two numerical features were kept.
* `titanic_training.csv` and `titanic_test.csv`: Titanic problem's training and test sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
